1. Create a git repo and clone it in local
2. Create a code.py and add code into it.
3. Do git add-commit-push before initiating DVC
4. pip install dvc, then do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. How to makedir S3 (Create new S3 Directory)
6. Giving remote origin access to dvc "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
13. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
14. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
15. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.
